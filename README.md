Three of the oservable trends I have found are:
  - There are more male players than female
  - Female players spend more per purchase
  - There is no consistant pricing practice for the most/least popular items
  
There are more male players than female. 
  With gaming, this is not a surprise. It is common knowledge that men are more likely to play video games than women. This game is no differnet in this. However, this does not mean we should be happy with what is already happening. While men might make up more of the market, what is the current ratio of men to women gamers and if that is not in line with the current trends we see with this game, how can we improve the game to bring in a more balance ratio of men vs. women gamers?

Females spend more per purchase.
  The games should look at its number of female players seriously. While men make up the vast majority of players (over 84%), women spend more on the game($3.20 per purchase vs. $3.02 per purchase). While the game could look at how to increase the amount men spend, another aspect of the game should be how the game can increase the number of women players. For every woman brought in, the game would see just below a 6% increase in revenue for every male it brought in. 
  
There is no consistant pricing practice for the most/least popular items.
  When looking over the current pricing structure. The most popular items are not consistantly priced at a similar mark. When putting together a pricing package, a review would want to be done on what makes items so popular or disliked and pricing structure can be built on that. Is an item not being purchased because it is priced too high? If it was lowered slightly to match its popularity, would you see an increase in purhcases of that product? How many more purchases would it take to make the same amount of profit? Woult the increase in purchase numbers surpass that? If an items is very popular but is priced low, could the price on that item be increased to increase revenue?
